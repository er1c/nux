<BODY>
Serializes (encodes) and deserializes (decodes) XOM XML documents to and from an
efficient and compact custom binary XML data format, without loss or change
of any information. Serialization and deserialization is much faster than
with the standard textual XM format, and the resulting binary data is more
compressed than textual XML.
