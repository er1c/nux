Using memory consumption close to zero, streaming serialization enables writing 
arbitrarily large XML documents onto a destination, such as an 
<code>OutputStream</code>, both for standard textual XML as well as binary XML;
Also includes a XOM Builder implementation that uses a StAX parser instead of a SAX parser; 
plus a XMLStreamReader implementation reading from an underlying XOM Document or fragment; 
plus other tools.
