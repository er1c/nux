Low-level contributions for XOM integration with XQuery and XSLT that will 
become part of the Saxon-8.2 release (as already discussed with Michael Kay).
Once that saxon release ships, these classes will be removed from the Nux distribution.
<p>
This package provides glue classes that enable Saxon to process a source document supplied as a XOM tree (see <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM"> http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM </a>).
<p>
These classes are not part of the core saxon.jar product, but are released as a separate saxon-xom.jar.
<p>
The package provides implementations of the Saxon DocumentInfo and NodeInfo classes that act as wrappers to the relevant XOM classes.
