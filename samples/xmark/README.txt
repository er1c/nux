This directory contains the queries and test data from the XMark XQuery
benchmark.

The aim of the XMark project is to provide a benchmark suite that allows
users and developers to gain insights into the characteristics of their
XQuery and XML repositories.

See http://www.xml-benchmark.org/ for details.

The original queries have been adapted to conform to the syntax of the
W3C Working Draft 4 April 2005 (which Nux/Saxon implements), but are
otherwise left identical.

The benchmark can be run via the java class

	nux.xom.tests.XQueryBenchmark 

See the javadoc of that class for details.
