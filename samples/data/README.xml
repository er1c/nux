This directory contains various test data files that can be used for
experimentation when getting started with Nux command line tools or
APIs.

All documents are real-world documents, except for db*.xml,
invoice*.xml, auction*.xml and randj10.xml, which are synthetically 
scaled up concatenations from a base document, hence exhibiting a large 
degree of redundancy.

For each document, a corresponding bnux binary XML document is given,
created with zlibCompressionLevel 0 (i.e. no ZLIB compression). 
If desired, the fire-bnux program can be used to create bnux documents 
exhibiting better compression, at the expense of performance.

The collection contains various document flavours, attempting to cover
the spectrum from very small to medium large file sizes, with and
without namespaces, with and without attributes (e.g. weblog.xml vs.
wurl.xml), with and without quasi-redundant repetitions (e.g.
lhc-teams.xml vs. db*.xml and invoice*.xml), with and without
indentation whitespace (e.g. lhc-teams.xml vs. lhc-teams-noindent.xml),
as well as document-oriented files (mostly narrative text, e.g. README.xml,
factbook.xml, romeo.xml), data-oriented files (database like records,
e.g. db*.xml, weblog.xml) and messaging-oriented files (control and/or
data flow messages e.g. soap*.xml, order.xml, invoice*.xml, 
p2pio-receive.xml, ubl.xml), as well as documents with mixed 
characteristics.

Individual document flavours may be useful for tightly focussed
benchmarks. All flavours taken together may serve as a good basis for
broad overall characterizations.

Good luck!
